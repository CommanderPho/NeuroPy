# NeuroPy
Modules for electrophysiology analysis using python.

### Overview
These modules are primarily developed for hippocampal recordings.

### Minimum requirements
* python 3.8.6
* Numpy 1.19.1
* Scipy 1.5.2


### Steps to follow before you start using modules:

   * Make sure your data folder has .xml and .eeg files.
   * Open the .eeg file in neuroscope and categorize bad recording channels as skipped. Similarly, mark any non-lfp channels as discard in neuroscope
   * Add ModulesPath to your pythonpath
